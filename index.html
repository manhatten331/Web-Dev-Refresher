            <h1>Welcome back! I know you will get the job you always wanted!</h1>
            <p>
                Let me tell you about my journey, when I was young I had my heart set on helping the world.
                At one point I thought that maybe through the medical field but after job shadowing a future career
                I quickly found out that wasn't my dream. My father inspired my curiousity for tech after we upgraded
                our family computer to run much better.
            </p>

            <p>
                After college I tried to find a job but like many others I wasn't able to find one. I took a job at a restuarant
                and it felt like my life was going backwards. Just when things couldn't get worse a hurricane wrecks havoc on my
                small town. My parents home was severly damaged and it felt as though life wasn't playing fair. After some time had
                pasted I asked my self what do I dream of doing with my life? The answer was quite simple, coding!
            </p>

            <p>
                From this point on would set the plan in motion for me to become a software engineer. I knew I wanted to help
                the world and another way I could do it was with the use of code. I inquired about a Full-Stack bootcamp to
                jumpstart my coding career. Although I wasn't able to get the career I wanted right away two years later I still
                haven't given up! I will become a software engineer and no one can stop me but myself!
